## Testing Steps
1. Send a message and verify it appears in the chat
2. Check if message is stored in database
3. Verify message bubbles display correctly
4. Test real-time message updates (auto-refresh every 5 seconds)
5. Test error scenarios (network issues, server errors)
6. Verify pop-up notifications appear when sending/receiving messages
7. Check debug console for detailed message flow logs
8. Test session synchronization between different parts of the app

## Debugging Tips
- Check the console logs for detailed information about message flow
- Look for "FETCH MESSAGES STARTED/COMPLETED" logs
- Monitor API responses and HTTP status codes
- Verify user session data is properly synchronized
