# Date Selector Enhancement Plan

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Analyze current User.dart file structure
- [x] Identify the _pickDate method in ReservationForm widget
- [x] Modify _pickDate method to disable current date selection using selectableDayPredicate
- [x] Add logic to detect weekday/weekend after date selection
- [ ] Test the implementation

## Implementation Details:
1. Use `selectableDayPredicate` in `showDatePicker` to disable current date
2. Add weekday/weekend detection logic after date selection
3. Show feedback to user about weekday/weekend selection via SnackBar

## Changes Made:
- Modified `_pickDate()` method to disable current date selection
- Added `selectableDayPredicate` that returns false for current date
- Changed `initialDate` and `firstDate` to start from tomorrow
- Added weekday/weekend detection logic using `picked.weekday`
- Added SnackBar feedback showing "Selected date: Weekday" or "Selected date: Weekend"

## Current Date Detection:
- Current date: DateTime.now()
- Disable dates where `date.isAtSameMomentAs(DateTime.now())`

## Weekday/Weekend Detection:
- Weekday: Monday-Friday (weekday 1-5)
- Weekend: Saturday-Sunday (weekday 6-7)
