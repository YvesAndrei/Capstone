# Chat Fix Plan - Admin/User Message Visibility Issue

## Problem Analysis
The issue is that admin cannot see user messages and user cannot see admin messages. Based on code review, the chat system uses simple user ID-based messaging without role-based filtering.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Database Structure Check
- Verify the messages table structure
- Check if messages are being stored correctly
- Ensure proper user IDs are being used

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Add more detailed logging to track message flow
- Log user roles and IDs for better debugging

### 3. Role-Based Filtering Implementation
- Implement logic to handle admin vs user message visibility
- Ensure both parties can see each other's messages

### 4. Testing
- Test with both admin and user accounts
- Verify message sending and receiving works both ways

## Implementation Plan
1. First, add enhanced debugging to identify the exact issue
2. Check database structure and content
3. Implement role-based filtering if needed
4. Test the complete solution
